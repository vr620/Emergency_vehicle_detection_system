#ROADMAP

**1st approach**
1. From audio files we need to extract important features i.e. MFCCs, Spectral Centroid, Zero Crossing Rate, Chroma Frequencies, Spectral Roll-off.

2.Once the features have been extracted, they can be appended into a CSV file.

3.Various classification algorithms can be used to get better accuracy .

**2nd approach**
1.We need to convert the audio files into PNG format images(spectrograms).

2.Train a CNN model for classification using these spectrogram images.
